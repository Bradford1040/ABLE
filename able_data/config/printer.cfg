# This file contains common pin mappings for the BigTreeTech SKR 3.
# This board can ship with one of two chips, STM32H743 or STM32H723.
# To use this config, during "make menuconfig" enable "low-level
# options", "STM32H743" or "STM32H723", "128KiB bootloader",
# and "25MHz clock".

# See docs/Config_Reference.md for a description of parameters.

[danger_options]
error_on_unused_config_options: True
#   If an unused config option or section should cause an error
#   if False, will warn but allow klipper to still run.
#   The default is True.
allow_plugin_override: True
#   Allows modules in `plugins` to override modules of the same name in `extras`
#   The default is False.
multi_mcu_trsync_timeout: 0.025
#   The timeout (in seconds) for MCU synchronization during the homing process when
#   multiple MCUs are in use. The default is 0.025
homing_elapsed_distance_tolerance: 0.5
#   Tolerance (in mm) for distance moved in the second homing. Ensures the
#   second homing distance closely matches the `min_home_dist` when using
#   sensorless homing. The default is 0.5mm.
#temp_ignore_limits: False
#   When set to true, this parameter ignores the min_value and max_value
#   limits for temperature sensors. It prevents shutdowns due to
#   'ADC out of range' and similar errors by allowing readings outside the
#   specified range without triggering a shutdown. The default is False.
autosave_includes: True
#   When set to true, SAVE_CONFIG will recursively read [include ...] blocks
#   for conflicts to autosave data. Any configurations updated will be backed
#   up to configs/config_backups.
bgflush_extra_time: 0.250
#   This allows to set extra flush time (in seconds). Under certain conditions,
#   a low value will result in an error if message is not get flushed, a high value
#   (0.250) will result in homing/probing latency. The default is 0.250
#homing_start_delay: 0.001
#   How long to dwell before beginning a drip move for homing
#endstop_sample_time: 0.000015
#   How often the MCU should sample the endstop state
#endstop_sample_count: 4
#   How many times we should check the endstop state when homing
#   Unless your endstop is noisy and unreliable, you should be able to lower this to 1
# Logging options:
#minimal_logging: False
#   Set all log parameters log options to False. The default is False.
log_statistics: True
#   If statistics should be logged
#   (helpful for keeping the log clean during development)
#   The default is True.
log_config_file_at_startup: True
#   If the config file should be logged at startup
#   The default is True.
log_bed_mesh_at_startup: True
#   If the bed mesh should be logged at startup
#   (helpful for keeping the log clean during development)
#   The default is True.
log_shutdown_info: True
#   If we should log detailed crash info when an exception occurs
#   Most of it is overly-verbose and fluff and we still get a stack trace
#   for normal exceptions, so setting to False can help save time while developing
#   The default is True.
log_serial_reader_warnings: True
log_startup_info: True

[save_variables]
filename: ~/able_data/config/variables.cfg
#   Required - provide a filename that would be used to save the
#   variables to disk e.g. ~/variables.cfg


[gcode_arcs]
resolution: 0.2
#   An arc will be split into segments. Each segment's length will
#   equal the resolution in mm set above. Lower values will produce a
#   finer arc, but also more work for your machine. Arcs smaller than
#   the configured value will become straight lines. The default is
#   1mm.

[respond]
default_type: echo
#   Sets the default prefix of the "M118" and "RESPOND" output to one
#   of the following:
#     echo: "echo: " (This is the default)
#     command: "// "
#     error: "!! "
default_prefix: echo:
#   Directly sets the default prefix. If present, this value will
#   override the "default_type".
